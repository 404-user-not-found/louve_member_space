La Louve member space
=====================

Repository for the member space of "La Louve".

Contributing
------------

We use Git / GitHub to manage sources. Here's a quick guide: `http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/`.

Development workflow should be as follows:
 - Work on a feature
 - Do a Pull Request
 - Merge once approved
 - Push to master

**TBD**:
 - What to install on which OS ?
 - How to launch a local development server for development / debugging purposes ?


Passwords
---------

There should no be any password commited in this repository. We have to create an example settings file to show how to configure them. For local development purpose, a setting file to be added to `.gitignore` can be added.

**Production passwords are stored and shared on LastPass**


How to deploy on production server
----------------------------------

Release process
---------------

**TBD**: detail here how to release the site, i-e go from code repository to live production server.
